# Quick Start: Test the Quality Improvements

## What Was Fixed

**Problem**: BioCultPapers extractions had only 43% field completion vs OLLAMA Desktop's 86%

**Root Cause**: OLLAMA's response was being truncated, cutting off last fields (metodologia, ano_coleta, pais, estado, local)

**Solution**: Added OLLAMA generation parameter `num_predict=8000` to allow full responses + strict parameters (temperature=0.1)

**Expected Result**: ~86% field completion (matching OLLAMA Desktop)

## Test Instructions (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Run BioCultPapers
```powershell
C:\Users\EDalcin\git\BioCultPapers\src\EtnoPapers.UI\bin\Release\publish\EtnoPapers.UI.exe
```

### Step 2: Extract Benchmark PDF
1. Click **Upload PDF**
2. Select: `C:\Users\EDalcin\Desktop\Desenv\artigos\Rapid_ethnobotanical_diagnosis_of_the_Fu.pdf`
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for extraction
4. Review the extracted data

### Step 3: Check the Results
Look for these key fields being **populated** (not empty):
- ✅ `metodologia` - Should have description text
- ✅ `ano_coleta` - Should be 2007
- ✅ `pais` - Should be "Brasil"
- ✅ `estado` - Should be "Pernambuco"
- ✅ `local` - Should be "Ouricuri Forest..."

### Step 4: Compare with Benchmark
**Reference (OLLAMA Desktop)**:
```json
{
  "titulo": "Rapid ethnobotanical diagnosis...",
  "ano": 2010,
  "pais": "Brasil",
  "estado": "Pernambuco",
  "municipio": "Águas Belas",
  "local": "Ouricuri Forest, Fulni-o Indigenous Land",
  "metodologia": "Research-action methodology...",
  "ano_coleta": 2007,
  ...
}
```

**Expected (BioCultPapers v2)**:
Should match or be very similar to above.

## Where to Find Results

### Extracted Data
```
C:\Users\EDalcin\Documents\EtnoPapers\records\[generated_record].json
```

### Debug Log
```
C:\Users\EDalcin\AppData\Roaming\EtnoPapers\logs\extraction-markdown-debug.log
```

Look for section:
```
>>> OLLAMA RESPONSE RECEIVED
Response length: [X] characters

--- FULL OLLAMA RESPONSE ---
{
  "titulo": "...",
  "metodologia": "...",  ← Should be present now!
  "ano_coleta": 2007,    ← Should be present now!
  ...
}
--- END OLLAMA RESPONSE ---
```

## Success Indicators

### ✅ Improvement Worked
- [ ] metodologia has a value (not null)
- [ ] ano_coleta has a value (not null)
- [ ] pais = "Brasil" (not empty string)
- [ ] estado = "Pernambuco" (not empty string)
- [ ] local has a value (not null)
- [ ] OLLAMA response in log shows complete JSON
- [ ] No truncation "[... truncated ...]" in response

### ❌ Issue Still Present
- [ ] Fields are still missing/null
- [ ] OLLAMA response appears truncated
- [ ] Empty strings instead of null values

---

## If Tests Show Improvement ✅

1. **Save the results** for comparison:
   ```
   Copy the extracted JSON to: C:\Users\EDalcin\Desktop\etnopapers_v2.json
   Copy the log to: C:\Users\EDalcin\Desktop\extraction_log_v2.txt
   ```

2. **Compare with benchmark**:
   - Field count: Should be ~12/14 (was 6/14)
   - Missing fields should now be populated
   - Quality should be 86% (was 43%)

3. **Validate against**: `docs/pdfTest/ollama.json`

---

## If Tests Show No Improvement ❌

1. **Check the OLLAMA response** in the log:
   ```
   C:\Users\EDalcin\AppData\Roaming\EtnoPapers\logs\extraction-markdown-debug.log
   ```
   Look for: `--- FULL OLLAMA RESPONSE ---`

2. **Verify the response includes**:
   - Full JSON with all fields
   - metodologia field
   - ano_coleta field
   - No "[... truncated ...]" in the middle

3. **If response IS complete but fields are empty**:
   - Problem is in JSON parsing, not response generation
   - Check if OLLAMA is returning empty strings instead of values

4. **If response IS truncated**:
   - OLLAMA parameters may not be applied
   - Try manually increasing num_predict further
   - Check if OLLAMA model supports the options parameter

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Field Completion | 43% | ~86% | +43% |
| Missing Fields | 8 | ~2 | -75% |
| Extraction Time | ~3min | ~3min | Same |
| Response Completeness | Truncated | Full | ✅ |

## Files Modified

**Code Changes** (in build):
- `src/EtnoPapers.Core/Services/OLLAMAService.cs` - Added generation parameters
- `src/EtnoPapers.Core/Services/ExtractionPipelineService.cs` - Full response logging

**Documentation** (for reference):
- `IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete technical details
- `TEST_PLAN_BENCHMARK.md` - Detailed testing procedure
- `INVESTIGATION_PLAN.md` - Root cause analysis

---

## Questions?

If you have issues or the test doesn't show improvement:

1. Share the **extraction log** (extraction-markdown-debug.log)
2. Share the **extracted JSON** result
3. Describe what fields are still missing

This will help identify if:
- The fix needs adjustment
- OLLAMA isn't applying the parameters
- A different issue is present

---

## Next Steps After Validation

If tests are successful:
1. Commit the validation results
2. Test with other PDFs to ensure consistency
3. Consider making OLLAMA parameters configurable in config.json

If tests show no improvement:
1. Investigate OLLAMA Desktop parameters
2. Check if model supports the options parameter
3. Examine full OLLAMA response in log for clues
