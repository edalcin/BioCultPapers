## Known Issues & Limitations

### Known Issues

**Current Release (1.0.0)**:
- None known at release time

**Workarounds for Common Scenarios**:
1. **OLLAMA Connection Fails**: Ensure OLLAMA server running on localhost:11434
2. **Large PDF Extraction Slow**: Expected for papers >100 pages (OLLAMA processing is CPU-intensive)
3. **Special Characters in Paths**: Use ASCII characters for installation paths

### Design Limitations (By Design)

1. **Single User**: Application is single-user, not multi-user capable
2. **OLLAMA Required**: PDF metadata extraction requires OLLAMA running
3. **Export Only (No Cloud Sync)**: Local SQLite storage is primary; records can be exported to a JSON file for BioCultDB via the "Exportar para BioCultDB" button; there is no automatic cloud synchronization
4. **Windows Only**: Desktop application for Windows 10/11 only at this time

### Future Enhancement Areas (Not in 1.0.0)

- [ ] In-app update checking and auto-update
- [ ] Batch PDF processing
- [ ] Advanced search with filters
- [ ] CSV export functionality
- [ ] Custom field definitions
- [ ] SQLite local database option
- [ ] Plugin system for custom extractors
- [ ] Cloud-based web version
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] API for third-party integrations
